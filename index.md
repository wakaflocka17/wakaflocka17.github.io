<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;"></h2>

I am a PhD Student in the [University of Cagliari](https://www.unica.it/it) at the TAIL (Trustworthy and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory), under the supervision of Prof. [Ludovico Boratto](https://www.ludovicoboratto.com) and Prof. [Mirko Marras](https://www.mirkomarras.com).

My research lies at the intersection of **Natural Language Processing** and **Information Retrieval** - with a special focus on building intelligent retrieval systems that are confidential. My research interest include **Recommender Systems**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** and **Confidential AI**, applied to Educational and Professional contexts.

Previously, I completed my MS in Applied Artificial Intelligence (summa cum laude) and my BS in Computer Science at [University of Cagliari](https://www.unica.it/it).
