## 🙇🏻‍♂️ About me
I'm a 22 year old MSc Student in Applied Artificial Intelligence at the University of Cagliari. I'm devoting myself to the study of different branches of this vast universe, including ML, Information Retrieval and NLP. Every day is a journey of discovery and learning, and I can't wait to see where this adventure will take me.

## 📖 Publications
At the moment, my library of publications is like a blank sheet of paper, full of potential and ready to be filled. I look forward to sharing my future works in this space. Stay tuned for news! 🚀
