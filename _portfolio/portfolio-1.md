In this project, a SmallWorld type network is used, which is not oriented, so the implementation of several centrality indices is required, including: Exponential-Subgraph Centrality, Resolvent-Subgraph Centrality and Katz Centrality. In addition, Broadcast and Receive indices were also implemented for temporal networks.
